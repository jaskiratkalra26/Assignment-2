Feature Summary The Document Processing Engine converts raw manuals into structured JSON with text chunks, images, tables, and metadata appropriate for multimodal embeddings and RAG retrieval. 2. Functional Requirements FR1: Extract all text from manuals while preserving hierarchy. FR2: Detect headings, subheadings, bullet lists, tables, captions. FR3: Extract all embedded images and associate them with page and block metadata. FR4: Detect tables and export row/column data. FR5: Chunk text into embedding-ready segments of 256-512 tokens. FR6: Link images to text using spatial or caption-based rules. FR7: Export unified structured output in JSON. 3. Non-Functional Requirements NFR1: Accuracy - text extraction error < 5% NFR2: Reliability - must handle corrupted blocks gracefully. NFR3: Performance - must process 100-page PDFs under 10 seconds where possible. NFR4: Scalability - must support asynchronous queue-based processing. 4. User Stories",

Detailed Feature Breakdown • Text Extraction: heading detection, bullet normalization, cleanup. • Image Extraction: bounding-box tracking, format normalization, quality thresholding. • Table Extraction: structural reconstruction, header identification. • Metadata: page_no, block index, bbox, inferred section, caption detection. • Chunking Engine: hybrid chunking using token count + semantic breaks. • Export Engine: outputs JSON/YAML/Parquet formats. 6. Risks and Mitigation R1: Scanned PDFs → Mitigation: OCR fallback using Tesseract. R2: Table parsing failure → Mitigation: bounding box extraction + ML-based table detector. R3: Image wrong mapping → Mitigation: coordinate-based matching + caption heuristics.",
